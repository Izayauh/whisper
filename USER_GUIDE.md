# 🎤 Whisper Local Dictation System - User Guide

A powerful, privacy-focused speech-to-text dictation system using OpenAI's Whisper running locally on your computer.

## ✨ Features

- **100% Local & Private** - All processing happens on your computer, no cloud services
- **GPU Accelerated** - Uses CUDA for fast transcription on NVIDIA GPUs
- **System-wide Dictation** - Works in any application
- **Real-time Feedback** - Visual status bar shows recording and transcription status
- **Smart Post-Processing** - Automatic text cleanup and formatting
- **Lightweight UI** - Minimalist status bar that stays out of your way

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.8 or later** - [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. **NVIDIA GPU** (optional but recommended for speed) - RTX series or GTX 1000+ series
3. **Whisper Model** - Already included in `models/` folder
4. **Whisper Binary** - Already included (`whisper-cli.exe`)

### Installation

1. **Run the launcher script:**
   - **Double-click** `start_dictation.bat` (Command Prompt)
   - OR **Right-click** `start_dictation.ps1` → "Run with PowerShell"

2. The launcher will automatically:
   - Check Python installation
   - Install required Python packages
   - Verify model and binary files
   - Start the dictation system

### First Time Setup

On first run, you may need to:
1. Allow Python through Windows Firewall (if prompted)
2. Grant microphone permissions
3. Wait for initial package installation (~1-2 minutes)

## 🎯 Usage

### Basic Controls

| Action | Hotkey |
|--------|--------|
| **Record** | Hold `WIN + CTRL` |
| **Transcribe & Paste** | Release `WIN + CTRL` |
| **Settings** | `WIN + CTRL + S` |
| **Exit** | `ESC` |
| **Self-Test** | `F8` or `CTRL + ALT + J` |
| **Debug Probe** | `F9` or `CTRL + ALT + D` |

### How to Dictate

1. **Position your cursor** where you want the text to appear
2. **Hold WIN + CTRL** and speak clearly into your microphone
3. **Release WIN + CTRL** when you're done speaking
4. The system will:
   - Process your speech (you'll see "⚙️ Transcribing...")
   - Automatically paste the text at your cursor position
   - Show "✅ Pasted!" when complete

### Status Bar Indicators

The status bar shows your current state:

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 🎤 Ready | System is ready, waiting for input |
| 🎙️ Listening... | Currently recording your voice |
| ⚙️ Transcribing... | Processing speech to text |
| ✅ Pasted! | Text successfully pasted |
| 🔇 No speech detected | Recording was too quiet or short |
| ❌ Failed | Transcription error occurred |

### Tips for Best Results

1. **Speak clearly** and at a normal pace
2. **Avoid background noise** - use a quiet environment
3. **Use a good microphone** - headset mics work best
4. **Wait for "Ready"** before recording again
5. **Keep recordings under 30 seconds** for best speed
6. **Check microphone settings** if you get "No speech detected"

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Changing Microphone

1. Press `WIN + CTRL + S` to open settings
2. Select your preferred microphone from the list
3. Click "Apply"
4. Click "Test" to verify it's working

### Environment Variables

You can customize behavior with these environment variables:

```batch
# Set custom Whisper binary location
set FLOW_WHISPER_BIN=C:\path\to\whisper-cli.exe

# Set GPU layers (default: 99 for full GPU)
set FLOW_WHISPER_ARGS=-ngl 99

# Set custom microphone device (by index or name)
set FLOW_INPUT_DEVICE=2
# OR
set FLOW_INPUT_DEVICE=USB

# Enable CUDA (default: enabled)
set GGML_CUDA_ENABLE=1
```

### Advanced Configuration

Edit `flow_local_dictation.py` to customize:

- **Hotkey**: Change `HOTKEY_HOLD` (line 56)
- **Model**: Change `MODEL_PATH_REL` (line 50)
- **Silence threshold**: Adjust `SILENCE_RMS_THRESHOLD` (line 74)
- **Post-processing**: Enable/disable filters (lines 61-63)

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### "No input-capable audio devices found"

**Solution:**
1. Ensure your microphone is plugged in
2. Check Windows Sound Settings → Input
3. Set your microphone as the default device
4. Restart the application

### "Whisper binary not found"

**Solution:**
1. Ensure `whisper-cli.exe` or `main.exe` is in the project folder
2. Check if files were blocked by antivirus
3. Re-download the binary files

### "No speech detected" every time

**Solutions:**
1. Open Settings (`WIN + CTRL + S`) and click "Test"
2. Check if RMS value is > 0.005 when speaking
3. Increase microphone volume in Windows
4. Try a different microphone
5. Adjust `SILENCE_RMS_THRESHOLD` in the script

### GPU not being used

**Solutions:**
1. Verify CUDA is installed: `nvidia-smi` in command prompt
2. Check `gpu_last.log` for errors
3. Run `gpu_run.ps1` to test GPU functionality
4. Ensure you have CUDA 11.7+ installed
5. Update NVIDIA drivers

### Transcription is slow

**Solutions:**
1. Use GPU acceleration (NVIDIA GPU required)
2. Switch to a smaller model:
   - `ggml-base.en.bin` (fastest, less accurate)
   - `ggml-medium.en.bin` (balanced)
   - `ggml-large-v3.bin` (slowest, most accurate)
3. Edit line 50 in `flow_local_dictation.py` to change model

### Text pastes incorrectly

**Solutions:**
1. Ensure cursor is in correct position before releasing hotkey
2. Wait for "✅ Pasted!" confirmation
3. Check clipboard manually (`CTRL + V`) if auto-paste fails
4. Some applications may block automated pasting

## 📊 System Tray

The application runs in the system tray with these options:

- **Toggle Listening** - Pause/resume dictation
- **Self-test (JFK)** - Test with sample audio
